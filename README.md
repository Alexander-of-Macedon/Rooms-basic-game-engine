# Rooms-basic-game-engine
This is a game engine that generates a tree of game rooms. 
It is written in Lua.
It uses a text-based interface.
You use the text-based interface to explore around by moving from room to room along the tree.
In each room, you are presented with door choices and you can select which way you want to go.
When you enter a new room you are informed of your surroundings (objects, room shape and size).
