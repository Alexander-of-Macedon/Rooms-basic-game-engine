# Rooms-basic-game-engine
This is a game engine that generates a tree of game rooms. 
It is written in Lua.
It uses a text-based interface. You read descriptions of your surroundings and available choices, and then type your selection.
You explore around by moving from room to room along the tree.
In each room, you are presented with one or two doors and you can select which way you want to go (right/left/back).
When you enter a new room you are informed of your surroundings (objects, room shape and size).
